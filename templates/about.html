      <p>I'm a student in Software Engineering at Auburn University in Auburn, AL.
         I have work experience working on an agile term in support of a GUI project written in C#,
         as well as building a web scraping tool in Python. Away from school, I enjoy working with web tools,
         sketching, and reading.</p>
