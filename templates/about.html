      <p>I'm a student in Software Engineering at Auburn University in Auburn, AL. I've interned two summers;
         I've spent one at heathcare-tech startup NextGxDx, Inc., and another at Defense contractor Dynetics, Inc.
         I have experience working on an agile term in support of a GUI project written in C#,
         as well as building a web scraping tool in Python. Away from school, I enjoy fitness and the arts:
         web tools, design, sketching, reading, and music.</p>
